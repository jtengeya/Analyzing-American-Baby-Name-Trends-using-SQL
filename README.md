# Analyzing American Baby Name Trends

The primary objective was to understand the shifts in preferences for baby names in America by examining the patterns of popularity over the period of 101 years.
Data was loaded into MySQL using a Python script on Baby_Names_Data_to_Mysql.py and SQL was used for data analysis and clauses like RANK (), SET, HAVING, LIMIT among others were utilized.
The SQL steps used in this project are included in the Baby_Names.sql file.:

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project was to discover:

1. Classic American names for over 100 years
2. The type of popularity for each name: timeless vs. trendy
3. The top 10 female names
4. The most popular female name ending in "a" since 2015
5. The most popular male names by year
6. The most popular male name for the largest number of years

## Results

The analysis results provided interesting insights into the trends and changes in American baby names over the past years. 

## Conclusion

The power of SQL queries was demonstrated in extracting meaningful insights from a large dataset. The trends and patterns uncovered in this analysis could be useful for sociologists studying cultural shifts, or even for forthcoming parents in search of the perfect name for their baby.
